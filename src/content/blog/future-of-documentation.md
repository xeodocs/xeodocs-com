Documentation often becomes a messy graveyard of outdated information. The traditional folder structures based on file types or arbitrary groupings fail to scale with modern complex systems.

## The Problem with Traditional Docs

In many organizations, documentation is scattered across:
- **Wikis** (Confluence, Notion)
- **Repositories** (`README.md`, `docs/`)
- **Diagram tools** (Miro, LucidChart)

This fragmentation leads to context switching and, inevitably, outdated information.

## Enter Domain-Driven Documentation

By aligning your documentation structure with your business domains (Bounded Contexts), you create a living system that evolves with your code.
