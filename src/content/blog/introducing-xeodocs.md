Today we are launching **XeoDocs**, a specialized platform that treats documentation as a first-class citizen in your development workflow.

## Key Features

1. **Markdown-first**: Write docs where you write code.
2. **AI-Ready**: Structured data that LLMs can actually understand.
3. **Visualizations**: Automatic architecture diagrams from code.

## Getting Started

It's as simple as installing our CLI:

```bash
npm install -g xeodocs
xeodocs init
```
