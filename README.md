# XeoDocs - AI-Powered Translations for Open Source

**XeoDocs** is a revolutionary open source initiative designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in the software ecosystem: **Language Barriers**.

Our mission is simple yet ambitious: to provide high-quality, up-to-date documentation in multiple languages for the world's most popular open source technologies.

## 🚀 About the Project

Language should not be an obstacle to learning a new framework or technology. However, maintaining up-to-date translations for rapidly evolving open source projects has historically been a monumental task. **XeoDocs changes that.**

We leverage advanced Artificial Intelligence to keep pace with the rapid release cycles of modern software, ensuring that non-English speaking developers have access to the same quality of information as their peers.

### How it Works

Our system operates in a continuous, autonomous loop:

1.  **Continuous Synchronization**: Background workers constantly monitor the upstream repositories of supported projects.
2.  **Smart Detection**: When changes are detected (features, fixes, typos), our system identifies the exact files that need attention.
3.  **AI Translation**: Intelligent agents process the content, translating it while preserving technical context, code blocks, and terminology.
4.  **Validation & Publishing**: The translated content is validated and automatically published to our platform.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
